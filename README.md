# A-Challenge

This project was completed for dev bootcamp as a js assignment. The page plays a guessing game with you where it generates a random number and asks you to guess what the number is. It will prompt you to go higher or lower, and you will lose if you cannot guess in 5 or less guesses.

We spend a lot of time looking for a way to show the computer's response outside of an input box, because that gives users the impression that it is a place for them to enter data and not to receive it. We wanted to stay away from pop-up alerts and finally found the output tag that is used for the computer prompts.

Improvements we would make with more time are:

1. Allow the page to resize to fit smaller screens
2. The user should lose once the timer runs out
3. When loading, the counter shows up as a black square for a second or so. We would try to cache this or otherwise help it load faster for a more seamless user experience.
